Hackathon Challenge: Bring Your Own Code to Loom!  

In this challenge, you’re required to implement some small code in Loom  
[8,3,2] smallest interesting colour code, see https://errorcorrectionzoo.org/c/stab_8_3_2  
[16,4,4] tesseract colour code, see https://errorcorrectionzoo.org/c/stab_16_6_4 to Loom    

Loom documentation on colour codes:  
https://loom-docs.entropicalabs.com/loom/tutorials/color_code/  

Loom source code, where you’ll find implementations of small example codes, such as the Steane code:
https://github.com/entropicalabs/el-loom/tree/main/src/loom_steane_code  

The QEC Zoo is also a great resource for these codes  

What You Should Do
Your goal is to set up a simple memory experiment:  
Initialise the code in logical |0⟩.  
Measure in the initialising Z basis.  

Then perform some sanity checks:  
Try Initialise in logical |1⟩ and verify that you measure logical 1.  
Initialise in 0 (or 1) and measure in the Logical X basis, does the measurement statistics behave as expected?
